## And so the journey ends...

The ship __{shipName}__ explodes, leaving all hope for humanity with it.

The surviving humans in the galaxy can only hope that somewhere out there, another ship has survived.

Consider contacting those who played before you to tell the tale of the ship's last stand, or even send the wreckage back along its path, to be buried where it began.

Or, perhaps, use parts of the wreckage to start anew. The choice is yours.
