__{shipName}__ is now on it's way, but there's still one star system between it and you: __{systemName}__.

Here, the Robots have built factories that will quickly fill the skies with destruction.

But there's also hope to be found in the ruins of __{systemName}__ - a couple of old shipyards that you can use to upgrade the ship or add completely new modules.

Getting them will give you a better chance at escape from this system, and for the journey beyond. Assuming you can get to them before the ship is overrun...
