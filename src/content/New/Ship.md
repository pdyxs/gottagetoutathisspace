## Assemble your ship!

Before you begin, you need to assemble the ship! Take all the Ship Module cards and put them together. The picture below shows you the default configuration of the ship.

### A tour of the ship
Your ship should have all the information about what each part does written on it.

In general, different parts of the ship give you access to different actions. You get 1 action per turn for free, and can spend fuel (stored in the Cargo Bay) to do more actions.
