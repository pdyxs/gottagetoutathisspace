## What This Is

"Gotta Get Outta This Space" is a print, play and post game for 1-4 players.

You're each stuck on a planet in the robot apocalypse, and one of the last human ships has just arrived in a nearby solar system!

Your goal: to guide the ship to pick you up, and then to Get Outta This Space!

As the ship gets improved and damaged, youâ€™ll change the board game components in front of you, writing on some pieces, destroying others, and making new ones with whatever materials you have on hand.

Once you've finished (assuming you do, in fact, get outta this space), you'll pack up the game and send it to someone else, who'll then do the same.

Together, you might just be able to stay alive and out of reach of the new robot overlords!

To begin, please enter the serial number of the ship (on the game's Cover Sheet), and the codename that you've been assigned (in the Ship's Log).
