## Assemble your ship!

Before you begin, you need to assemble the ship! Take all the Ship Module cards and put them together (see the picture below).

The ship starts with 1 Fuel - place it on the Cargo Bay module.

### A tour of the ship
Your ship should have all the information about what each part does written on it.

In general, different parts of the ship give you access to different actions. With a cockpit, you can do 1 action per turn. You can spend fuel (stored in the Cargo Bay Module) to do more actions.
