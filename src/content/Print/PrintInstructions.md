## Printing your Pieces

Below is a summary of the pieces you've chosen to print. To print them, simply use the print command in your browser (File->Print).

You can choose the counts of some of the components here. Counts above the minimum will be for extra pieces that you and others will use to create new parts of the ship or crew. It's recommended that you print all of them.

Be careful not to set your margins too wide, or it might shrink the pieces.
