Having gotten outta this space, you would normally pack up this ship and send it to someone else! There'll also be a spot to upload a photo of the ship as it currently is, and to make notes about how the components might have changed.

However, as this is a test version, please just get in touch with Paul and let him know how it went. At some point, you'll be able to send this on.
