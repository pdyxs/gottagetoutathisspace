Your mission: to pick yourself up off the planet, become part of the crew*, and to Get Outta This Space.

Though if things get tight, you might want to skip the first part and save the ship, and with it, a hope for humanity. Your call.

_*Remember to come back and click the 'Pick Up' button when you get a Survivor - that's how you'll become a crew member!_
