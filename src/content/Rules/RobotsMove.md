Each turn, the Robots move and spread. Execute all three of these steps in order.

1. In any squares with robots with direct line of sight to you (orthogonally, not diagonally), one robot moves towards you.
1. In any squares with robots that don’t have direct line of sight to you, add 1 robot
1. If a square now has 4 or more robots on it, the robots spread. Move 1 robot to each square next to it. Any robots that move off the board are removed

> If spreading the robots cause another square to have 4 or more robots, they also spread

_If you run out of robot tokens, use whatever you have on hand - cubes, coins, blu tack - whatever works!_
