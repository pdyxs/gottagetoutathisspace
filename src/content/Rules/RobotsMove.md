Each turn, the Robots move in the following way

1. In any squares with robots with direct line of sight to you (orthogonally, not diagonally), one robot moves towards you.
1. In any squares with robots that donâ€™t have direct line of sight to you, add 1 robot
1. If a square has 4 or more robots on it, the robots spread. Move 1 robot to each square next to it. Any robots that move off the board are removed

> If spreading the robots cause another square to have 4 or more robots, they also spread
