One ship takes actions allowed by their modules.

You always get to take 1 Action per turn for free. You must use Fuel to take additional actions.

<p class="requires-crew">At any point during your turn, you may use a Crew member's Power. Powers don't cost you any actions, but you must exhaust (turn over) the Crew Card once you use the power.</p>
