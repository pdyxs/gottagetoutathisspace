One ship takes actions allowed by their modules.

You always get to take 1 Action per turn for free. You must use Fuel to take additional actions.

At any point during your turn, you may use a Crew member's Power. Powers don't cost you any actions, but you must exhaust (turn over) the Crew Card once you use the power.

When you Pick Up Survivors or Install Modules or Upgrades, click on the relevant square and then click the ___Pick Up___ or ___Install___ button to see what happens.
