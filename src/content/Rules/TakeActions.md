One ship takes actions allowed by their modules.

When you arrive in a new square, you immediately pick up any Fuel in that square.

For anything other than Fuel, check your Cargo Bay for how to pick it up. When you do, go to the map, click on the square and then click the ___Pick Up___ button to see what happens.

Your cockpit allows you to take 1 Action per turn for free. You must pay 1 fuel to take additional actions.
