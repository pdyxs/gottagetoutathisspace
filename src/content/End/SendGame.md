It's time to send the game to someone else!

Pack it up as best you can, making sure that you've not missed any components (check the Captain's Log, and don't forget the Cover Sheet!), and send it to someone else who you think might enjoy it.

You'll be able to check back in here to see the journey of __{shipName}__ and its crew - hopefully the ship makes it out.
