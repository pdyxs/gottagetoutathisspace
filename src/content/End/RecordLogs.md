## You won! Now for some paperwork

You got outta this space! Now it's time to send this game onto someone else, to continue the journey of __{shipName}__ and its crew!

Before you do, take a bit of time to do the following:
* Update the Ship's Log with all the relevant details
* Make sure that any modules or crew that were destroyed or killed are no longer in the game. You can tear up the cards, put a big cross through them or even write a eulogy on the back - the choice is yours, but they should be clearly not usable anymore. You can also choose whether to send the remains on, or to thoughtfully dispose them yourself.
* Update any of the Components descriptions to ensure that they match the components you have.
* Take a picture of the current state of your ship and upload it below. This will allow the next player to set up the ship the same way
