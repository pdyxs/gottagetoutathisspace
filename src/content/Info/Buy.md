## Get yourself a nice copy

There a two options for getting yourself a nice copy of Gotta Get Outta This Space.

If you're in Australia, I recommend getting the Deluxe version.  By the time you pay for your own shipping, it only costs ~$5 more, includes a bunch more stuff, and allows us to keep more of the profits (since we bought some stock for ourselves).

If you're overseas and would like something like the Deluxe version, [please let me know](/contact) - if there's enough demand I'll work out a way to make it happen!
