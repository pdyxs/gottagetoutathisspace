## Help me make more

I'm passionate about the availability of high quality games and interactive media that connects and educates people.

I also think that great educational content should be free.

To that end, I'm making a series of freely available interactive projects, with this being the first.

For now, these are small projects, made around my paid work. But I'd like to be able to expand them: both by hiring collaborators to join these projects and by being able to increase the amount of time I spend on them.

So if you like this and want to help out, please consider one of the following options.
