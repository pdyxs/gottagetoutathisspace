## Why did this get made?

Gotta Get Outta This Space started as a Ludum Dare game that I ([Paul](/who)) was making as a part of Ludum Dare 46 (theme: "Keep It Alive").

The Coronavirus crisis had just begun, and with so many people locked in their homes, I was interested in new ways that we could connect that didn't involve being in the same physical space. This spawned the "print, play and post" concept - a game that you change as you play, before sending it to the next player.

It quickly became clear that I wasn't going to finish this in the 48 hours (I was also learning a new web framework at the same time... maybe not the best idea), but still wanted to finish it. Around the same time, I was looking at doing some monthly projects to build up my art practice (this became the [Momemtum framework](https://medium.com/@pdyxs/momemtum-8e375bea7a8e)). This seemed like a great candidate for a first game, and so it became my May 2020 project.

[Alistair](/who) came onto the project soon after, working on the art of the game.

If you want to see what else I've made or follow along as I make more things, see the [I want more](/moreplease) page.
