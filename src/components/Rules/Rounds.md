Gotta Get Outta This Space takes place in rounds. In each round, every ship acts.

Each round is made up of turns - in each turn one ship acts, as do the robots. Please find instructions for a turn below.

In each round, you can choose what order ships have turns, but every ship _must_ have a turn before you start a new round.
